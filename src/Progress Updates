Progress On Game

Day One - Friday, March 11
-Imported the class and accidentally imported someone else's. This person had Technoblade as their player and zombies as their aliens. Background was minecraft. 
-Implemented the main method
-Imported JFrame and made un-initialized frame variable
-Learned about public, static, and final. Created Height and Width variables which will never change!
-Initzialized the frame variable in the constructor "LeagueInvaders"
-Made setup method (void)
-Did all the normal stuff with frame in the setup window - default close operation, set visible, size
-Made league invader object and initialized it, then used it to call the setup method. This ends the runner set up.
